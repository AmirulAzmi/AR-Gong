# AR-Gong
AR Gong using osgART

This is an assignment for Real-time Computer Graphics (Year 3 Semester 2016/2017-1) where we need to create a simple augmented reality demonstration based on examples from OsgART coding.

For this demonstration, osgARTcollide.cpp is used where it shows the interaction of two markers when the two markers moved to each other.

Run: open 'Debug/_run_osgartcollide.bat'
